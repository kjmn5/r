00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.449
Here at Udacity, We believe you learn best by doing.

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:14.285
That's why there are a bunch of projects and practice quizzes throughout the course.

00:00:14.285 --> 00:00:17.399
This will help you develop fluency in SQL,

00:00:17.399 --> 00:00:21.144
Python, and Git through the lens of a data analyst.

00:00:21.144 --> 00:00:23.000
When you complete each project,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.594
you will submit it to one of our expert reviewers,

00:00:25.594 --> 00:00:28.144
who will give you personalize feedback.

00:00:28.144 --> 00:00:32.854
The projects in this program will be an awesome addition to your portfolio.

00:00:32.854 --> 00:00:36.439
These projects have been specifically designed to mimic

00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:40.839
what projects you would encounter in an actual data analysis job.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.570
So, take on these projects knowing that you're definitely learning

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.475
skills that you can showcase and talk about in your portfolio.

00:00:49.475 --> 00:00:51.539
In the first project,

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.439
you will use SQL Queries to analyze a relational database about movie rentals.

00:00:57.439 --> 00:01:03.259
You'll write SQL code to query both basic and advanced SQL Queries,

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:07.015
and create visualizations to show your findings.

00:01:07.015 --> 00:01:08.859
In the second project,

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:14.670
you'll use Python to analyze by share data collected from three cities.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.635
You'll write code to clean the data, compute descriptive statistics,

00:01:19.635 --> 00:01:26.330
and create visualizations to show how the data is distributed and in the final project,

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:30.500
you will build a GitHub profile and use version control to

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.840
share a few examples of concepts that you have learned in this course.
