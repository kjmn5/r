00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.835
Welcome to the Programming For Data Science Nanodegree.

00:00:11.835 --> 00:00:16.950
We're so excited that we are part of your journey towards a career in data science.

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.184
If you haven't done programming before, you may ask,

00:00:20.184 --> 00:00:24.254
why do you need programming for analysis? Good question.

00:00:24.254 --> 00:00:26.179
Broadly speaking, two of

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:31.905
the most important foundational skills for analyzing data are statistics and programming.

00:00:31.905 --> 00:00:36.520
The two main purposes for programming and data analysis.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.330
The first is that programming allows you to work with much larger datasets than is

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.210
possible with spreadsheet applications like Excel or Google Sheets.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.045
Google now processes 40 thousand queries per second,

00:00:51.045 --> 00:00:55.325
which is 1.2 trillion queries every year.

00:00:55.325 --> 00:01:01.755
Similarly, 200 billion tweets are completed on Twitter every year.

00:01:01.755 --> 00:01:07.825
Amazon processes 1.1 billion transactions each year.

00:01:07.825 --> 00:01:12.560
Processing this much data will not be possible without programming.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.004
The second thing programming allows is the ability to automate processes

00:01:18.004 --> 00:01:23.969
that previously might've had to be completed manually and will take much more time.

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:26.750
In this program, you will learn how you can use

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.030
programming to perform data analysis tasks.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.969
We will start with introduction to SQL.

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:38.629
This will be followed by an introduction to Command Line interface and Shell.

00:01:38.629 --> 00:01:42.219
Next, we move on to introduction to Python.

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:45.754
Here, you will learn Python programming and be introduced

00:01:45.754 --> 00:01:49.489
to Python libraries, NumPy and pandas.

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:55.034
This will set you up nicely for the tools you need for the data analyst nanodegree,

00:01:55.034 --> 00:01:58.004
which is the next course in the sequence.

00:01:58.004 --> 00:02:02.795
Finally, we will introduce you to Version Control and GitHub.

00:02:02.795 --> 00:02:07.939
This will be an exciting journey and you will not only gain valuable programming skills,

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:11.645
but also gain a clear insight to all you can to accomplish.

00:02:11.645 --> 00:02:13.159
So, let's get started.
