00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.870
What we found, was that people dramatically underestimated the

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.300
size of their audience. Typically, they guessed that their audience

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.220
was about a quarter of the size that it

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.770
actually was. When I first approached this problem, I, plotted

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.280
a bunch of histograms. I wanted to know how

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.650
many people do people think are in their audience. So,

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.200
the first thing I did was, you know, I opened

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.070
up R, and in GG Plot, I plotted a histogram

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:26.960
of people's guesses.
