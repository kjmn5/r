00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.980
Cool. It looks like Moira got started the same way

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.270
as us when we investigated birthdays. let's make more sense of

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.790
our data, especially for this bin of people born on the

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.590
first. We can break this histogram into twelve histograms, one for

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.810
each month of the year. The code would look like this.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.098
First, I'm going to add a layer and that layer is going to

00:00:19.098 --> 00:00:23.240
be called facet_wrap. Facet_wrap takes a formula where we

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.540
have a tilde, and then we're going to use the variable that

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.170
we're going to split our data over. In this case, dob_month.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.890
We have the number of columns set equal to three. And

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.630
then we can run this code and see the output. So

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.050
notice, we took our one histogram and split it into 12 histograms.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.830
Since we set ncol are the number of columns equal

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.150
to three, we can see the three columns in our one

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.620
plot. Now, this one stands for January. This two would be

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.570
for February, and so on. And if I wanted to, I could

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.940
have used ncol equals four. It would have just

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.900
given me a slightly different plot with four columns. Before

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.920
we keep coding anymore, I want to focus on this facet

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.129
wrap. And specifically, this formula right here. in general, facet

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.090
wrap takes in a formula inside of its parenthesis. The

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.900
formula contains a tilde sign followed by the name of

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.800
the variable that you want to facet over. This allows

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.910
you to create the same type of plot for each

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.650
level of your categorical variable. In our case, we wanted

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.060
to make histograms of dob_day, one for each month

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.490
of the year. A similar layer to facet wrap is

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.730
facet grid. Facet grid also takes a formula, but it's in

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.300
a little bit different form. It's formula contains variables that

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.620
we want to split over in the vertical direction, followed by a

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.715
tilde sign, and then the name of the variables we

00:01:37.715 --> 00:01:41.070
want to split in the horizontal direction. In general, where you place

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.170
the variables can change how the graph is laid out, and the orientation of them.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.480
Now, facet grid is generally more useful to

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.430
use when you're passing over two or more

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.570
variables. If it's just one I would use

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.090
facet wrap. You can learn more about facet

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.640
wrap, facet grid, and how to format plots
