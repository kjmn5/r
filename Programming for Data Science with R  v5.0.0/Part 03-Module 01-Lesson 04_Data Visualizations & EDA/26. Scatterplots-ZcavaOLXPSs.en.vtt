00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.650
Here are some of the things that I noticed. It

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:06.600
looks like younger users have a lot of friends. These young

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.280
users seem to have thousands of more friends than most

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.970
users over the age of 30. You also might have noticed

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.430
that there are some vertical bars where people have lied

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.020
about their age, like 69 and also about 100. Those users

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.410
are also likely to be teenagers, or perhaps fake accounts, given

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.480
these really high friend counts. If there's something else that you

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.030
noticed that we didn't cover, share it in the discussions.
