00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.610
As Moire mentioned, we may need to adjust our axes to get a better look at the

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.270
data. Let's see an example of this using our

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.140
Facebook data set. I want you to create a

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.160
histogram of friend counts. Try this in "R" and

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.010
then paste your code in the box. Once you've

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:16.580
got your plot, I want you to think about

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.200
how this plot is similar to Moire's first plot.
