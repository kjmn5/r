00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.150
So after plotting histograms and looking at peoples guesses

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.130
about their audience size, I wanted to see how

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.120
that matched up with there actual audience size. So

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.300
then at that point I turned to scatter plots. So

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.420
here's an example of the first scatter plots that

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.630
we did looking at this. So on the x

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.070
axis is how many people actually saw that post.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.810
And on the Y axis is how many people our

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.020
survey respondents guessed saw the post. If they guessed

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.880
perfectly accurately, their guess would fall along this dotted diagonal

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.110
line. That's the perfect accuracy line. But one of the

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.910
things that stands out with, in the scatter plot, is

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.050
that you see these horizontal stripes. That's again because

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.470
people are guessing these regular numbers. You see a really

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.140
clear stripe at about 50 and another really clear stripe

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.860
at a hundred, and a little bit of a stripe

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.532
at 200. And you really see that these all of this,

00:00:54.532 --> 00:00:58.310
the points on the scatter plot are just this big cluster at

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:03.720
the bottom. So people are guessing very small numbers. 20, 50, something

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.959
like that, when in reality their audience size is 100 or 200.
