As you continue learning about EDA in the next

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:04.840
lessons, you'll get to hear from Moira. Moira's done

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.180
some exciting work at Facebook and she'll be sharing

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.170
one of her projects with you. Let's hear from her.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.660
&gt;&gt; So one of the things that I've been looking at

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.540
lately is whether people's perception of their audience on Facebook matches up

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:22.250
to the reality. Who's actually seeing the content that they're sharing. Because

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.450
who think is in your audience really affects how you present yourself.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.580
So to investigate this problem, I worked with Michael

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.210
Bernstein, Brian Carr, and Eytan Bakshy. And together we

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.470
ran a survey where we pointed people to a

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.340
post that they'd made in the last couple of

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.260
weeks, and we said, how many people do you

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.430
think saw this post? And then we took their

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.650
responses to that question and we actually counted how

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.000
many people had viewed that post for about a second

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
at least and we found that there was a pretty big

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.720
mismatch between people's perceived audience

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.040
size and their actual audience size.
