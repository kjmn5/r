00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.570
Let's answer our question using a numerical summary

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:04.780
instead. I want you to run some code

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.270
in R to answer the following questions. First,

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:12.240
what's the www_like count for males, and second, which

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.400
gender has more www_likes? Is it the males

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.240
or the females? These two questions will automatically

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.820
be graded so you don't really need to

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.000
go to the solution video unless you get stuck.
