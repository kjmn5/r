00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.140
It looks like females on average have slightly more friends

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.600
than men. Since I can see that this median line

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.640
is slightly higher. That's what this black line is. It

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.290
represents the median or the middle 50% of friend counts for

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.300
females and for males. Now this difference isn't very large.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.060
So let's zoom in to take a closer look. This box

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.535
for females and this box for males Represents the middle

00:00:22.535 --> 00:00:25.340
50% of values in our sample. So, I think it makes

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.330
sense that we zoom in even more to take a closer

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.479
look. We should consider any values less than 250. Now, there's no

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:35.740
exact choice here, I'm just choosing something that seems reasonable, since the

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.570
bulk of my data is down here. After running this code, we

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.740
can now see that the bulk of user friend count is

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.640
similar for the middle 50% of men as it is for the

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.050
middle 50% of women. Its just our females are slightly higher for

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.550
friend count. let's look at actual values though and compare the values

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.690
to what we see in our box plot. We can look at

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.960
those values by using the by command and running a summary of

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.070
our friend count split by gender. So first, I want to include

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.960
my friend count which is the variable I want a summary of. I

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.170
want to split it over gender and I want a summary. Running this

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.760
code, I get an output of my table, which shows me the

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.050
minimum maximum values for both genders, as well as the core tiles.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.600
The first core tile for women is 37 and that looks about right

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.750
in our graph. The third quartile or the 75%

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.600
mark is at 244 and that's all the way up

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.270
here. This means that 75% of female users have friend

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.370
counts below 244. Or another way to say this is

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.260
that 25% of female users have more than 244 friends.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.870
Similarly for the men, we can see how the first

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.650
quartiles and the third quartiles match up to the box

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.730
plot. Now, you might have remembered that we used coord_cartesian

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.330
in the solution video from before. We did this so that

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.400
way, the table output would match our box plots. If we would

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.480
have just used the ylim parameter inside of qplot, we would have

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.820
gotten different quantiles that wouldn't match our picture. This is just a

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.920
subtle difference that you should be aware of when working in

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.430
R. Now, it's your turn to answer a different question. On average,

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.360
who initiated more friendships in our sample? Was it men or was

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.380
it women? Used some of the techniques that we just covered and

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.139
then write a few sentences explaining how you

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:10.660
came up with your answer. This second question won't

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.810
be automatically graded, but it's important that you

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.880
know how to communicate your analysis to other people.
