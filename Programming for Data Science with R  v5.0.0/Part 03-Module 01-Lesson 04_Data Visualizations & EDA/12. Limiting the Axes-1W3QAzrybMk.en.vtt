00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.090
To avoid looking at all this long tail data, we

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.570
can use the x limb parameter inside a q plot. This

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.350
parameter takes a vector where we have the start position

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.280
and the ending position of our axes. In our case, we

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.930
want to examine friend counts less than 1000. Running the

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.590
code, I can see that I have my plot with friend

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.420
counts less than 1000. Now there is another way to create

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.290
the same plot. Here I won't use the x limb parameter.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.190
Instead I'm going to add a layer. I use limits

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.390
instead of x limb as the parameter inside of here since

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.400
I know this adjustment is already for the x axis. That's

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.270
why its called scale x continuous. There's also a counterpart for

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.010
the y axis called scale y continuous. One of the neat

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.190
concepts of GG plot is that you can build up your

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.260
plot in layers. We're going to discuss layers later in this lesson,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.490
but for now I'm going to keep using the q plot syntax.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.820
So far we've learned how to create histograms, how to

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.870
facet them, and how to adjust our axes. But up

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.240
until now all of our histograms have had a default

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.030
setting. We've been getting this error message for a while

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.330
about the bandwidth defaulting to a range over 30. It

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.210
turns out we can set the bandwidth ourselves to reveal

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.760
interesting trends in the data. Let's hear what happened during

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.760
Moira's investigation when she altered the bandwidth of her histogram.
