00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.330
To answer this question we want to write code that

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:04.800
looks very similar to the code from before. We want to

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.660
create a box plot to compare the distribution of the number

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.220
of friendships initiated for our male and female users. So let's

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.960
just remind ourselves what variables we have in our data frame.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.660
So for friend requests, I think I'll use friendships_initiated that sounds

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.630
right. To make my box plot I'll pass x the variable

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.875
gender, since that's my categorical variable. And then I'll pass y,

00:00:23.875 --> 00:00:27.190
friendships_initiated. Now I need to subset my data frame just like

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.550
from before. And then I'll need to tell qplot that I

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.990
want to box plot. So I'll set the geom. Looking at

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.990
this plot, we see that most users make less than 500 friend

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.120
requests. So let's set our y limb setting zero as our

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.020
minimum and 500 as our max. So I'll add the cored_cartesian layer

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.120
and set my limits. It's really close, but it looks like

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.890
females have slightly more friend requests. Since the median black line is

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.250
slightly higher for females than this median black line

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.890
for males. Now, this might be too close to call.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.250
So, I say we should zoom in again. This time,

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.520
we'll change the upper limit to 150. Yeah, it looks

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.340
like females initiate slightly more friendships on average. Let's also

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.810
check this with a numerical summary. I can use the

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.990
by command and split friendships_initiated by gender and then, find

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.010
their summary. So, I'll take my friendships_initiated, split it by

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.320
gender and then run a summary. And here's our output. And

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.400
we can see that the median for females is 49 whereas

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.420
the median for males is 44. Now, you might be wondering,

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.000
why should we even create this box spot to begin with if

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.240
we can answer our question with a numerical summary. Well, it's

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.810
helpful to understand the distribution of the data. So in the case

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.160
of the box plot, we can see the middle 50% of

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.310
values for each segment of our categorical variable. Our box plots also

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.590
let us get a sense of alliers. So in one

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.930
way, they're much more rich with information than just this table.
