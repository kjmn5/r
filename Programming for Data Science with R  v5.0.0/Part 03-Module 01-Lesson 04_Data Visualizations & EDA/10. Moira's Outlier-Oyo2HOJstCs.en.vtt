00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.460
And the first thing you get is this really terrible

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.530
plot with one big, tall bar. And that's because most people

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:09.350
guessed a kind of small number, but at least one

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.170
person guessed 10 million people, saw my post, which was not

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.270
true. The first thing I needed to do was adjust

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.980
the axes so that I could actually see the bulk of

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.240
the data. So, I cut this one outlier out. And

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.370
then, I looked basically at people who guessed a few thousand

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.820
or, or below. Then, then you get a slightly better histogram by

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.920
adjusting the axes. And, you can still see that the bulk of

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.700
the data was in the smaller ranges, but it still was kind

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.330
of hard to, to see how large people thought their audiences were.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.660
&gt;&gt; Moira just explained how she encountered an outlier in

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.970
her data. And I want you to think about what

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.050
type of outlier do you think it was. So, try

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.690
answering this question. Do you think Moira's outlier was an example

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.170
of bad data about a non-extreme case, bad data about an extreme case,

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.940
or was it good data about an extreme case? Choose the best answer here.
