00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:02.880
We haven't talked about this yet, but you do want

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.500
plots to speak for themselves. If you look back at some

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.850
of the plots we've created, you'll notice that the labels

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.950
on the x axis and the y axis are automatically generated.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.040
By default, ggplot2 uses the variable names for the labels.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.380
That's why we can see that tenure divided by 365 appears

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.430
right here. We pass that to x, so that's going to

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.070
appear in our graph. Now, this might not be the best

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.026
label for the x axis, so let's change this. To do

00:00:29.026 --> 00:00:32.870
so, we can use the xlab and ylab parameters. Now, making sure

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.090
I have a comma after each of these new parameters, I

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.460
can run this code and see the labels on their plot. Yeah,

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.700
that's a lot better. Now, your x-axis might look slightly different

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.820
from mine, and that's because I added scale-x continuous as a layer,

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.440
and I made the breaks go from zero to seven. That's

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.270
what this bit of code does here. Now, when you conduct EDA,

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.520
your plots don't need to be perfect. I

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.700
don't want you to stress about formatting, but do

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.790
focus on making sensible choices for scales and limits

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.290
on each axis. When you return to your plots

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.620
and to your code later, labels can function as

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.280
comments about what the code was intended to do.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.080
Likewise, if you were to share a plot with

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.600
a colleague, labels can make your plots more understandable.
