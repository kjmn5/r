00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.440
Let's start by looking at birthdays using ggplot. Ggplot is a

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.430
graphics package that allows us to make visualizations. We're using ggplot

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.340
since it's easier than the base graphics that comes with R.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.980
It has some nice features, such as the format of plots and

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.790
legends that are automatically generated. The first thing we need to

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.920
do is to download and install the ggplot library. Now that

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.070
we have got the ggplot loaded, let's use the qplot function

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.120
to plot a histogram showing the number of users whose birthdays fall

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.790
on any given day. I can run their name pf

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.500
command to get an output of all my variables. Now, I'm

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.670
trying to create the date of birth by day histogram

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.220
for all my users. So, I'm going to use the date of

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.858
birth day variable, here. For the qplot function, I'll pass

00:00:41.858 --> 00:00:45.226
it two parameters, x and data. X is going to take the

00:00:45.226 --> 00:00:48.950
variable of data birthday, and data's going to take the variable pf,

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.280
which is where all my data comes from, from the pseudo

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.880
Facebook dataset. Running this command, I see my histogram come

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.680
out in a plot window below. Now, you might notice that

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.770
this plot is slightly different in color. If you're curious about

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.560
setting color and themes in R, see the instructor notes. Getting

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.780
back our code in console, you can see that we

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.840
get this warning message, when we run the code. This is

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.360
fine for now but, you should think about what this warning

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.490
message means. So, here's our histogram so far but, I want to

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.190
add one more layer to this plot. Let's fix the label on

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.540
the x axis, so we can see everyday of the month here. So

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.750
to adjust the x axis, I'm going to add a + sign right

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.270
after my code and then hit Return. This immediately takes me down the

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.080
next line with a little bit of indentation right here. I'm going to

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.700
add the layer scale x discrete and then give it the priority order

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.210
breaks from 1 to 31. This is because I want all my

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.550
days to be 1 to 31, the days of the month. And running

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.480
this code, we can see we've done a little bit

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.580
better. What are some things that you notice about this histogram?
