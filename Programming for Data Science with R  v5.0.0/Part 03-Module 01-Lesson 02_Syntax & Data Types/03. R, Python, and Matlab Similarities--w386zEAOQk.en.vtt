00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.820
There are three popular languages for
interactive data analysis, R, Matlab,

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:06.150
and Python.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.810
Our decision of which language to use
should be based on the task we're doing.

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.580
All three languages run inside
an interactive shell or

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.120
a graphical user interface.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.730
They all emphasize storing and
manipulating data as multidimensional

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.900
arrays, which is very useful for
data analysis.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.510
All three have many packages
available that extend the original

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.820
functionality of the language.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.270
All three languages are typically
slower than C, C++, and Fortran,

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:44.070
though there are several techniques
that can help speed up things.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.660
All three languages can interface
with native C++ code for

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.227
speeding up bottle necks.
