00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.230
In the first command we have
the operator percent and

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.950
duplication percent between two vectors.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.580
This operator corresponds to the inner
product operator between two vectors.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.120
The inner product operator

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.030
multiplies the corresponding elements
of the two vectors and sums them up.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.951
The result is 565.

00:00:23.951 --> 00:00:26.052
In the case of the second command,

00:00:26.052 --> 00:00:29.310
we have the function t()
applied to the array x.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.880
The function t() transposes
the matrix or array so

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.860
that rows become columns and
columns become rows.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.920
The four by five array is
now a five by four array.
