00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:06.290
In the first row, we have the c
function which stands for concatenate.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.904
What it does, it takes its argument,
in this case 4,3,3,4,3,1 and

00:00:11.904 --> 00:00:17.880
creates a vector of values 4,3,3,4,3,1
and assign it to the variable x.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.194
In the second row,
we wish to get the length of a vector or

00:00:22.194 --> 00:00:24.780
an array using the length function.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.330
Since the vector has six values,
the outcome of the command would be six.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.104
The third row shows an example
where we create the vector of

00:00:35.104 --> 00:00:37.726
logical variables of length 4.

00:00:37.726 --> 00:00:42.553
We see here that the vector is
assigned false default value

00:00:42.553 --> 00:00:45.517
to all the logical variables in it.

00:00:45.517 --> 00:00:49.460
And that is because false is
the default value of the logical type.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.460
In the last example,
we create a numeric vector of length 3.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.612
The outcome is 0,

00:00:54.612 --> 00:00:58.935
0, 0 again, because the default
value of the numeric type is 0.
