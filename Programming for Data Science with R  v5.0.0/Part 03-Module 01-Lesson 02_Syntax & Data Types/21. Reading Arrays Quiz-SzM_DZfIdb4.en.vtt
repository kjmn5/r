00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.850
In this quiz,
we will work with this array right here,

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.570
the array we created in the previous
quiz of values of 1 to 20,

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.900
sorted in an array of sizes 4 by 5.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.690
If we want to access a specific
element in the array, we can do

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:22.240
that using square brackets, just
like we access elements of a vector.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.980
But because we have,
in this case, two dimensions,

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.897
we need to separate the two
indices with a comma.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.930
The first index correspond
to the row index.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.730
And the second one is the column index.

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.850
If we leave either the row or
the column index out,

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.745
that corresponds to taking all
possible values within that dimension.

00:00:44.745 --> 00:00:51.815
So in this case,
if we write x [2,] we left

00:00:51.815 --> 00:00:56.950
the column dimension unspecified and
the row dimension being 2.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.000
As a result,
we'll get the entire second row.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:07.110
In the quiz, please look at
the commands listed here and here and

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.730
fill in the tables with the values that
result from running these commands.
