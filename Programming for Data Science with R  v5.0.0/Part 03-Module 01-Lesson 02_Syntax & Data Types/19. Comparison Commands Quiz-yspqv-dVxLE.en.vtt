00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.708
In the first case, we have w  00:00:10,781
What happens,
is that r compares the logical

00:00:10.781 --> 00:00:15.510
test whether the value is  00:00:18,370
To each one of the values in the vector.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:23.270
Now remember the vector is 0,
0.1, 0.2, 0.3, all the way to 1.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.620
And when you run this logical test on
each value of the function, you get at

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:33.260
the beginning values are all true, where
the vector elements are smaller than or

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.710
equal to 0.5 and later on they become
false as the values get larger.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.950
The second row, takes the result of the
first row which is a vector of true and

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.190
false values and calls the function any.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.570
The function any returns true, if any of

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.290
the logical values in the vector
is true, returns true as well.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.337
In this case, some of the elements
of the value w  00:01:10,020
in this line are true, therefore the
function any will return true as well.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.780
In the third row,
we check whether all the values and

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.550
the logical vector are false.

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:23.050
Since the vector w less than or equal to
zero point five is partially true and

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.370
partially false, the outcome
of this command will be false.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.090
The last row, extracts the indices

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.160
of the logical vector in which
the logical value is true.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.890
Remember again, the value of
the vector w  00:01:46,850
The first six values are true and
the last five values are false.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.240
Therefore, the function which
will return indices 123456 which

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:58.950
are the indices of the vector w
