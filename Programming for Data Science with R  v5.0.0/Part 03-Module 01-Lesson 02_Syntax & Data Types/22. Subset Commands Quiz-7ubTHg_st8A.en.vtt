00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.880
Please fill out the right column

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.150
with the outcome of running
the code in the middle column.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.225
Remember, again, that the vector
w is a vector of values 0.0,

00:00:11.225 --> 00:00:14.865
0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and so on until 1.

00:00:14.865 --> 00:00:17.670
The same vector we used
in the previous quiz.
