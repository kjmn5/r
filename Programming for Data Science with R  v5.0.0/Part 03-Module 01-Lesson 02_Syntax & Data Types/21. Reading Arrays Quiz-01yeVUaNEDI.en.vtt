00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.290
In this case, we have the array,
x, with a row index, -1,

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.990
and an unspecified column index.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.350
The negative row index actually
corresponds to take all rows except for

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:16.730
the specified row.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.040
So -1 will correspond to all
rows except for the first row.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.710
Since we left the column unspecified,
this corresponds to all the columns.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.700
The result being, we'll get a new array
which corresponds to the old array,

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.660
specifically, the second, the third,
and the fourth rows of the old array.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.890
In this case,
we refer to the array, x, but

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.140
instead of referring to the array, x,
with one pair or row column indices,

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.910
we refer to the array, x, with a vector
of rows and a vector of columns,

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.810
specifically vector (1,2) of rows and
(1,2) of columns.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.620
Remember the function c concatenates
the values inside of it and

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.700
returns a vector with
the corresponding values.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:09.000
In this case, we'll create a new array,
y, that is extracted from the old array,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.570
x, specifically the first two rows and
the first two columns.
