00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.750
Numeric data types are the most
common scalar type.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.300
They correspond to
floating point values.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.900
Here's an example.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.918
The variable a is assigned
the value 3.2, and

00:00:12.918 --> 00:00:16.030
the variable b is assigned the value 3.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.170
Integers are somewhat less common in R.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.410
Here's an example of
defining an integer.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.352
We take a numeric variable and

00:00:24.352 --> 00:00:28.170
we cast it using the as.integer
function to a variable c.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.280
Logical type corresponds to true or
false.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.310
Here's an example where we assign
the value true to a variable d.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.200
In this case, we take the logical
type in the variable d and

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.380
we cast it to a numeric variable e.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.977
In this case,
we casted true into the numeric value 1.

00:00:49.977 --> 00:00:52.508
Here is an example of
a string data type.

00:00:52.508 --> 00:00:56.510
We can use either double quotation or
single quotation in R.
