00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.070
In this quiz we have four rows.

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:07.551
Where in each row we execute specific
code trying to accomplish a specific

00:00:07.551 --> 00:00:08.470
purpose.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.530
Please fill in the right column
with the outcome of the code.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.172
Please note, that the vector w is
a vector of values between 0 and

00:00:18.172 --> 00:00:24.635
1 with increments of 0.1, the same
vector we saw in the previous quiz,

00:00:24.635 --> 00:00:32.039
specifically a vector containing
the values, 0, 0.1, 0.2, etc until 1.
