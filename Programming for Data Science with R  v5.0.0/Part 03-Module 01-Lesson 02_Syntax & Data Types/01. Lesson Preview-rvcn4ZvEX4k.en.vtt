00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.930
The R programming language is
a useful tool for data scientists.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.740
Most production code in industry is
written in languages such as C++ and

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.740
Java that you may already know.

00:00:12.825 --> 00:00:14.325
Using these languages for

00:00:14.325 --> 00:00:18.835
data analysis and visualization
is usually not very effective.

00:00:19.835 --> 00:00:24.535
R is much better suited in these cases
as it is fast to develop code in it and

00:00:24.535 --> 00:00:25.569
experiment with it.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.970
But in many cases, engineers and
scientists need a combination of R and

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.060
a fast production language like C++ and
Java.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.310
We will start with a brief
description of R and

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:44.570
how it is related to other languages,
and then describe its basic syntax.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.510
As the lesson progresses, we will learn
additional features of the language

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.100
until at the end you will be able to
write reasonably effective R programs.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.990
We will also spend some time going over
scalability issues related to R and

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.009
how to handle them.

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:07.409
The lesson is divided
into four sections.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.000
Getting started with R.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.010
Data types in R.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.950
Control flow and functions in R.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.180
And scalability and interfaces in R.
