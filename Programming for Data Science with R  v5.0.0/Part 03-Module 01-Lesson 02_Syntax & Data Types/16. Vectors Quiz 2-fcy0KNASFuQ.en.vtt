00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:03.170
In the first row,

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:09.030
we try to create a vector that
has multiple repeated values.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.999
In this case we want to have
the value 3.2 repeated ten times.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.600
The first argument being
the value we want to repeat and

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.680
the second argument being how
many times we want to repeat it.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.200
In this case we assign it
to the argument times so

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.330
the function knows how to interpret it.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.196
We see here that the outcome
is a vector of ten values 3.2.

00:00:31.196 --> 00:00:36.740
In the second row, we try to create
a vector that spans numbers between

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:43.090
zero and one, with increments of
0.1 in between consecutive numbers.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:49.560
The outcome is a vector of value 0.0,
0.1, 0.2, and so on until 1.0.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.407
The third line achieves the same
goal as the second line, but

00:00:54.407 --> 00:00:59.637
instead of calling the function
seq with an increment argument,

00:00:59.637 --> 00:01:04.200
we call the function with
an argument specifying how many

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.266
values we want the vector to contain.

00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:12.076
In this case we basically say we
want 11 values between zero and

00:01:12.076 --> 00:01:16.860
one that are equally spaced and
we get the same vector.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.860
Creating such sequences of values that
span to extreme values is very important

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.950
in order to create grids that can be
used to graph data and functions.
