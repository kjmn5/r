00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.450
In this case,
we have standard algebraic operators,

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.070
such as multiplication and
addition applied to an array.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:13.540
The arithmetic operations are applied to
each elements of the array separately.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.620
And we get a new array,
as a result, of a similar size.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.350
In this case, if we take every
element of this array, and

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.010
we multiply it by 2 and add 1,
we get the resulting array here.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.560
Please note that his will also apply
in the same way for vectors or for

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.960
higher dimensional arrays, such as
three-dimensional arrays and so on.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.670
In this case, we have a matrix
multiplication operator.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.090
The array y is interpreted as
a matrix and we have the matrix

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.730
y multiplied by itself using
matrix multiplication operation,

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.909
which is different from
element y's product.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:57.100
For example, this element right here, of
the result, is the result of multiplying

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:03.050
the first row of y with the first column
of y, using the inner product operation.
