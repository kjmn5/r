00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.710
Now that we know how the three
languages are similar,

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:05.450
let's look at how they're different.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.470
R and Python are open source and
free, Matlab is not.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.734
Contributing packages to R is
a more standardized process.

00:00:16.734 --> 00:00:21.939
R is seeing an incredible growth in
the number of package contributions.

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:25.190
In this graph,
we see on the x-axis, the year.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.687
And in the y-axis,
the number of contributed packages.

00:00:29.687 --> 00:00:34.155
The y-axis is displayed on the log
scale and the linear trend here,

00:00:34.155 --> 00:00:39.350
shows an exponential increase in
the number of contributed packages.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.750
R's standardized process of
contributing packages has led to

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:51.290
a large group of motivated contributors
who contribute high quality packages.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.870
R syntax is more suitable for
statistics and

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.439
data, as it was originally designed for
that purpose.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.819
Finally, R has better graphics
capabilities than both Python and

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:07.583
Matlab.

00:01:07.583 --> 00:01:10.935
R is popular in statistics,
bio-statistics and

00:01:10.935 --> 00:01:13.099
social sciences communities.

00:01:13.099 --> 00:01:18.381
In particular, Matlab is very popular
in engineering and applied math.

00:01:18.381 --> 00:01:21.238
Python is popular for data analysis.

00:01:21.238 --> 00:01:26.080
But in addition, it's also popular for
web development and scripting.
