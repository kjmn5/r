00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.134
Now that you've learned to use Git to control the version

00:00:03.134 --> 00:00:05.835
of both your local and remote repositories,

00:00:05.835 --> 00:00:08.064
it's time to put your skills to work.

00:00:08.064 --> 00:00:11.039
In this project, you will simulate the workflow used in

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:14.894
industry on the bike share code you completed for the previous project.

00:00:14.894 --> 00:00:18.324
Now, there will be four main parts to this project.

00:00:18.324 --> 00:00:23.500
First, you'll set up your repository on both your local machine and then up on GitHub.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.390
Then, you'll improve the documentation on a documentation branch.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.234
Third, you'll refactor your code on a refactoring branch.

00:00:32.234 --> 00:00:36.965
The actual part of your code that you choose to refactor for this doesn't really matter.

00:00:36.965 --> 00:00:39.830
Finally, you'll need to merge all of your branches

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.375
together and add the changes to the remote repository.

00:00:43.375 --> 00:00:47.030
The following pages will lead you through this process and inform

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.200
you about what the guidelines are for submission. Good luck.
