00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.555
R is the leading programming language for statistics and data analysis.

00:00:04.555 --> 00:00:07.360
One of the main advantages of using R is that we can

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.280
build up an analysis line-by-line encode.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.580
We can save all of our work in a file and go

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.190
back to see what we investigated at a later date.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.820
Having R Scripts allows you to easily share your work with others,

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.580
and you can see what others are doing with data.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.020
R also has over 2,000 user contributed packages that increase its functionality.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.050
Now, one of the main packages we'll use throughout this course is ggplot2.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.590
Ggplot2 is a graphics package that lets us create

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.425
plots and graphs with just a few commands.

00:00:35.425 --> 00:00:38.270
We'll learn more about ggplot in the next lesson.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.120
But just to give you a taste of it,

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.485
here's an example of a plot you can create.

00:00:42.485 --> 00:00:45.845
Now, don't worry about memorizing or understanding all of this code.

00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:48.725
You'll have plenty of practice with this later in the course.

00:00:48.725 --> 00:00:53.060
I just want to show you how a few lines of code can create amazing graphics.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.090
I'm going to load up the ggplot library and a color library,

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.055
then I'm going to load the diamonds dataset.

00:00:58.055 --> 00:01:00.410
With this function, I'll create a scatter plot.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.555
Let's check out this plot in detail.

00:01:02.555 --> 00:01:05.765
This plot shows the relationship between price and carat

00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:08.960
of almost 54,000 round cut diamonds.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.440
I'd say R is doing very well for such few lines of code.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.450
The last thing I want to mention is that you can use R anywhere.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.280
It's free open source software that works on any operating system.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.575
As a result of this,

00:01:20.575 --> 00:01:22.035
R has a large, active,

00:01:22.035 --> 00:01:24.370
and growing community of users.
