00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.280
You can review the log of command entered by going to the history

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.740
so that would be panel two. Help documentation appears in the lower right

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.070
hand side which would be panel four. To clear the work space you

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.520
can either use panel two or panel three. You can run a command

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.329
in here to clear the work space or you can use the icon

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:19.590
located in panel two. It should look like a sweeping broom. We can

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.040
run a bunch of commands from a file from panel one. Plots appear

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.790
down here in the lower right, so that would be panel four, and

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.220
all of our objects and memory appear up here, in

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.300
our environment or our work space. So that's panel two. And

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.610
finally to read the results from functions or from calculations, we

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.950
simply look at the console, where our output comes, panel three.
