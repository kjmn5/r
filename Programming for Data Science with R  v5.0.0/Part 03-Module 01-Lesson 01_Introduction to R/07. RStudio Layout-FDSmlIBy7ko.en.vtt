00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.138
This is RStudio, it's an IDE or an Integrated

00:00:03.138 --> 00:00:07.043
Development Environment and it's what we'll be using to create

00:00:07.043 --> 00:00:09.810
R scripts and to create plots. It's a point and

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.580
click system that organizes our workspace and it has some

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.530
nice features for creating and sharing work. Here's a basic

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.920
tour of it. The main interface contains four panels that

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.150
can be resized as needed. Now, you may only see

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.580
three panels when you open RStudio. If so, just open

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.610
a new R script by clicking on the file, and then

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.060
New File &gt; R Script. So, in the top left here, we

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.070
have R scripts. These are the files in which we will type

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.430
our R commands. We'll also save these files, so we can alter

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.130
them or share them at a later time. In the bottom

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.520
left, we have the R Console. You can type in R

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.810
commands here. However, these R commands will only be saved in

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.870
a temporary history. The commands won't be saved to a file like

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.240
up in here that can be reviewed at a later

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.630
date. In the top right of RStudio, we have two

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:01.690
tabs. One called Environment and one called History. The Environment will

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.620
contain all the objects, functions and values that are in the

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.580
current working memory for R. History on the other hand

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.870
will keep a running log of any of the R commands

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.880
that we run. Now we can run R scripts directly from

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.980
our files but we can also type them into the console.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.600
No matter which way we type them in the History will

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.570
capture them. And finally, in the lower right, we have the

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.890
Files, Plots, Packages, Help and Viewer section. You'll learn more about

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.800
these later but this is where our plots or graphs will

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.710
first appear when we run an R command that creates a

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.140
visualization. Now that we've gone over the layout of RStudio,

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.450
I want you to match some actions that you might do

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.134
in each panel of R. Remember this first panel is for

00:01:41.134 --> 00:01:44.155
R files or R scripts. This second area is for the

00:01:44.155 --> 00:01:47.760
workspace or the history. This third space is the Console where

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.690
we get our output. And this fourth panel is for Files,

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.460
Packages, Plots, and Help. So for example, if I asked you

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.680
to match the activity to one of these panels, like

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.380
save an R script that would correspond to box number one.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.690
You can save them by clicking on this button. Now we

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.530
could of course use the main menu, but I'm actually include

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.740
as any one of your options here. The main purpose of this quiz is

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.140
just to get you familiar with RStudio. So here are your list of actions.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.740
And I want you to pair it with the panel where you would do it

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.320
in RStudio. Put the number of the corresponding panel in each of the boxes.
