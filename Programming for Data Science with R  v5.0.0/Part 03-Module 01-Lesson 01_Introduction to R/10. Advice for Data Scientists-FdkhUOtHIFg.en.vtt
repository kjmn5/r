00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.430
Before we wrap up this lesson, let's hear from Eytan and Sean, who are also

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:05.960
two data scientists at Facebook. They'll offer

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.370
their advice for how to work with data.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.100
&gt;&gt; My advice to data scientists, or future data

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.370
scientists is find data sets that you're interested in,

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.690
and, and work with them, and play with the

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.950
data. And just developed experience with playing with data.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:25.350
&gt;&gt; Good data science comes from good

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.440
questions, not from fancy techniques, or from, you know, having the right

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.130
data. It comes from motivating your research with an idea that you care

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.690
about, and that you think other people will care about. It's almost, you

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.730
almost have to think about it like a journalist would. You have this

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.430
audience and they're going to consume the work that you produce, and you

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.070
want them to care about it, and be interested. And so, starting with

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.920
the right questions, in, in particular, something that motivates you as a person

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.460
is really the right starting point, not, like, you know, some fancy technique

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.050
that you want to learn.
