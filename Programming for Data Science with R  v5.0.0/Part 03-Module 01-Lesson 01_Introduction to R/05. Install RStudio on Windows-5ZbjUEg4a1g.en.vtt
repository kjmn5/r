00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.630
In this video, I'll show you how to install R

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:06.025
and RStudio. To get started you want to go to

00:00:06.025 --> 00:00:10.460
cran.rstudio.com. And then you'll click on the link to download

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.560
R for Windows. If you never installed the R programming language

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.030
before, then click on this first link. Since it's your

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.380
first time downloading it. Now depending on your version of Windows,

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.920
you might need to see the frequently asked questions. I'm

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.460
set for my computer, so I'm going to go ahead and download

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.610
R for Windows. I get a warning message and

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.120
I want to keep the file. Now this might take

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.090
some time to download, so just be patient. Then

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.200
you want to open the file, and then run the program.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.970
A set up wizard should appear and now you

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.260
just want to walk through all the steps. I'll set

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.790
my language, and then I'll just continue installing by

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:51.530
hitting next. I'm just going to accept the defaults here and

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.860
then install it to R. I'll leave these as is,

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.010
so that way a desktop icon will be created. And

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.890
it's going along. Great. Now I'm finished with my setup.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.420
So that was just part one of the installation process.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.210
That just gave us the programming language R. Now we

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.990
need to go and install RStudio. RStudio is a graphical

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.630
user interface for programming in R. It's basically a point

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.120
and click system that let's us work with data really easily.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.460
So first let's just go to download now to get RStudio.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.170
We're going to get RStudio for our desktop. So just click this first

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.220
button. Now there's going to be a lot of links here, and you

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.700
really just want this first link. It's going to be the version of

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.150
RStudio that's recommended for your computer, and for your operating system.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.740
Notice how this one's for Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7, or Windows

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.240
8, so I'll click on that, and then I'll keep the file.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.580
And you can see it downloading in the bottom left corner, here.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.890
It looks like it's ready, so I'm going to

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.540
open this up. I'll then install RStudio into this path.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.730
And create a Start Menu folder as well. Great. I'm done. And this is

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.180
what RStudio looks like. Now yours might

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.300
look slightly different than mine and that might

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.610
be because the file's open. So if I go to File &gt; New File

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.639
&gt; R Script this opens a basic R script which allows me to start programming in R.
