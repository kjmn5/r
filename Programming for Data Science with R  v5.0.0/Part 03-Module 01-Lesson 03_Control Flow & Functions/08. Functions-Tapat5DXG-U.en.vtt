00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.350
Let's see how to define a function in R.

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.960
We define a function
here called myPower.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.420
We do that by calling the function,
function.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:16.750
And that function returns the function
and assigns it to the name myPower.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.660
The result of this computation here is
that we define the function myPower that

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.440
can be later called by
R in a different place.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.380
Let's see how the definition works.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.200
After the key word function,
we provide the arguments.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.330
In this case,
we have two arguments, bas and pow.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:45.230
The function will raise the first
argument to the power of the second.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.030
Or, bas to the power of pow.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.980
We provide here default values 10 and
2 that will be assigned

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.870
if the corresponding values are missing
when the function is called.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.100
After we provide the parameter names,
we have curly braces and

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.680
inside the curly braces,
we have the function code.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:14.300
The function code raises bas to the
power pow and then return the result.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.790
Let's see some examples
how to call a function.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.420
In the first case we call the function
with two values two and three.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.300
These values are assigned to bas and
pow in the corresponding order.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.780
In the second case we reverse the order.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.000
And because we reverse the order,
we need to tell

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.700
the function myPower that 3 should
be assigned to the variable pow,

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.910
and 2 should be assigned
to the variable bas.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.280
In the third case we
only pass one parameter,

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.180
bas, and the function will assign the
default value to the other parameter.
