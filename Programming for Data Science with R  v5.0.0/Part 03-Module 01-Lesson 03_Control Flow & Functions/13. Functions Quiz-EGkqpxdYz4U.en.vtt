00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.380
When we have a function in R,
we can pass arguments

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.320
in the default order in which they're
specified in the function definition.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.772
But if we provide names
associated with these parameters,

00:00:13.772 --> 00:00:17.244
we can change the order
of the parameters, and

00:00:17.244 --> 00:00:23.290
we can only pass a subset of
the parameters potentially out of order.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:30.790
In this quiz, let's call this function
foo with a variable x,y,z in that order.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.230
In the order y,x,z.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.550
And only with the variable z with x and
y set to default.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.000
The past values should be 10,
20, and 30,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.820
assigned to the corresponding variables,
x, y, and z.
