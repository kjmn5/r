00:00:00.141 --> 00:00:05.619
We have a for loop that iterates over
every element of that vector here.

00:00:05.619 --> 00:00:09.620
The vector is seq(1, 100, by=1),

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:16.480
which is a vector of values between
1 and 100 separated by distance of 1.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.250
That's basically 1, 2, 3,
4, all the way to 100.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.180
So the for loop with iterate over
every value in that vector, and

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.820
every iteration,

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.480
the corresponding value will be
assigned to the iteration variable num.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.940
Within the for loop,

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.640
we're going to increment the variable
sum with the iteration variable num.
