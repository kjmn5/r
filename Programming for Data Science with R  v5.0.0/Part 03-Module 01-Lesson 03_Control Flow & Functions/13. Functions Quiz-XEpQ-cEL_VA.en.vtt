00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.570
In the first case, we want to
call foo with the variables 10,

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.410
20, 30 passed in that order.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:13.400
We don't need to provide any names
because we just passed the parameters

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.020
in the default order specified
in the function definition.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.840
In the second case, we want to pass this
values in a different order, so we have

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.320
to specify names of the variables that
these values will be assigned to.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.090
In the third case we
only passed the value 30.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.470
Implying to the variable Z,
we omit the variables X and

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.280
Y because they're going
to get the default value.
