00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.450
Control flow using if-else in R is
pretty similar to other languages.

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:06.420
Here is an example.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.490
We first have an if clause
followed by else if

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.520
that is executed,
if the first if clause is not correct.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.590
We can have multiple else if clauses.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.900
At the end we have an optional
else clause that is executed,

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.950
if none of the previous
clauses are executed.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:34.520
Logical operators in R are similar to
the logical operators in C++ or Java.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.495
An AND operator is basically &amp;&amp;,
OR operator is ||,

00:00:40.495 --> 00:00:45.105
equality is = =, and inequality is !=.

00:00:45.105 --> 00:00:50.908
These operators take two values and
return true or

00:00:50.908 --> 00:00:57.690
false based on the logical
condition that they describe.
