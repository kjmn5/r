Even if the student does not upload the correct file types please try and open what they have submitted and give them as much feedback as possible.  Please include a screenshot of how to save to .txt if the student saves the queries as a different file type not do this correctly.\n2. Look for interesting patterns and insights in the data rather than simply providing summary statistics.\n - Use other advanced SQL functions, such as the CASE function, DATE functions; as well as other SQL data cleaning functions, such as the CONCAT function.\n - Use a combination of Window functions, CTE and/or subqueries in your SQL queries.\n - Make good use of color, size, and shape in your visualizations.\n - Use the slide title and/or chart description on each slide to state the key insight of the visualization.\n",
